# ALGORITHMS FOR UNCORRELATED TRACK PROCESSING
Collaborating with Airforce Research Laboratory researchers and a 5-person undergraduate student team to design and benchmark uncorrelated track processing (UCTP) algorithms for satellite data, leveraging the Google Gemini API to query into OpenEvolve LLM and improve evaluation accuracy. Currently we are evaluating through small problem sets to configure functions for UCTP, then convert into larger scale formats in a high-performance computing cluster using Nvidia SuperPOD to test on larger scale datasets with hopes of finding an efficient evolutionary algorithm and AI architecture to replace.
